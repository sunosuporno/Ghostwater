# Ghostwater

A mobile-first wallet and trading app that connects Base (EVM) and Sui. Sign in with Google, manage balances, claim a human-readable subdomain on Base, send to addresses or names, and trade with margin on Sui via Deepbook.

## What it does

- **Auth & wallet** — Sign in with Google (Privy); get an embedded wallet. View balances on Base (EVM) and Sui; switch networks from the Home screen.
- **Subdomains (Base mainnet)** — Claim a name like `yourname.ghostwater.eth` on Base, set preferred chain and token (and optional Sui address). Send to others by name instead of raw addresses.
- **Send** — Send tokens on the current network to a 0x address or a Ghostwater name; cross-chain routing via LI.FI when sending to a name.
- **Margin trading (Sui)** — Create a margin manager, deposit, place long/short orders, and close positions. On Base, use the Deepbook tab to deposit from Base into Sui margin pools.
- **Swap** — Bridge/swap between chains (e.g. Base ↔ Sui) from the Swap tab.
- **LST (Base mainnet)** — Stake ETH or USDC on Base to Lido wstETH on Ethereum.

Supported networks: **Sui Mainnet**, **Base**, and **Base Sepolia** (testnet for light testing).
